# Creatures of Ki — Teshi Renew

The teshi from Shooki's **Creatures of Ki**, brought forward to RimWorld 1.6.

**I am not the author of this mod.** The animal, its textures and the original idea are Shooki's;
the 1.0 → 1.4 continuation is Mlie's. All I did was the work needed to make the teshi run on 1.6.
Credit goes to them; mistakes in the update are mine.

Original mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2726461020 — Mlie's continuation,
still online, last supporting 1.4. Abandoned, not withdrawn.

## What the mod does

It adds one animal and its eggs.

- **Teshi** — body size 3.5, health scale 4.0, worth 2000 silver. Two claws at 18 damage, a bite at
  25, a head bash at 12. Trainable to intermediate, it nuzzles, and it lives eighty years.
  Comfortable from −80 °C to 60 °C, which is to say anywhere.

  A large, bipedal feathered predator with **four wide banded ears**, two a side,
  a short dark crest and a thick banded tail. The showcase depicts it resting;
  that pose does not contradict its bipedal anatomy. Damaging one turns it manhunter
  three times in four.
- **Teshi eggs.** A mated female lays a stack of two fertilized eggs every fifteen days, and they hatch
  after fifteen more. An unfertilized egg is defined too, as every egg-layer has one, but a teshi does not
  lay it in normal play.
- Spawns sparsely in shrubland, temperate forest, boreal forest and tundra, a little more in
  rainforest, and almost never on ice sheet or desert.

Taming failure turns it manhunter one time in twenty; damaging it, three times in four. It is a
predator with four times a human's health pool, so that matters.

No DLC required. No Harmony, no framework, no dependency of any kind.

Content mod: removing it mid-save will lose any teshi and any teshi eggs already in play.

## What is not included

Creatures of Ki is four fifths a **playable race** — the Kija, their faction, their pawn kinds and
their name makers — and that half of the mod requires Humanoid Alien Races. None of it is here, and
this mod needs no Humanoid Alien Races. The teshi referenced neither the race nor HAR, which is why
it could be lifted out cleanly. If you want the Kija, use the original.

## What changed in the 1.6 update

Two breakages, both silent in different ways.

- **Wildness stopped being a race property.** In 1.6 it is a `Wildness` **StatDef** declared under
  `statBases`, and the old `<race><wildness>` was ignored outright. Ludeon gave the stat
  `defaultBaseValue -1`, deliberately outside the `[0,1]` range, precisely so animals that lost the
  value show up. Untouched, the teshi tamed about as easily as a rat.
- **The unfertilized egg was missing.** Every egg-laying animal in Core declares one, and the teshi
  did not. `EggTeshiUnfertilized` was written, taking the market value of its fertilized counterpart.
  It is not what makes the animal work, and a teshi does not lay it in normal play: one laying is a
  single stack of two eggs, all fertilized while a fertilization is left, and the teshi has one, so a
  mated female lays a stack of two fertilized eggs. Without a fertilization she is pinned at 0.9 of her
  progress and does not lay at all. Only the dev-mode gizmo that sets the progress to 1 gets an
  unfertilized laying out of the comp, and there the def is what it asks for.

  This entry used to say that `CompEggLayer` throws whenever an animal lays unfertilized, and later that
  the second egg of a mated laying has nothing to be but unfertilized. Neither was right. The first went
  further than the evidence; the second was inferred from the two settings and never read off
  `ProduceEgg`, which builds one stack. `CompTick`, `CanLayNow`, `NextEggType` and `ProduceEgg` were
  read in the compiled game, and `_tools/Run-Functional-Tests.ps1` covers the pinning. `TESTS.md`,
  scenario 4, and the Pickle scenario `03-laying-and-hatching` describe the in-game confirmation that
  remains to be performed.

No balance value was changed. Nothing else in the teshi's defs needed touching: no `deathAction`,
no toxic sensitivity, no C#.

## Verification

Every def reference and every `ParentName` resolves against **Core alone**, so no DLC is required,
and each reference points at the right *type* of def. Checked with the standalone suite against installed Core data.

Run the standalone technical suite:

```bash
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _tools/Run-Functional-Tests.ps1
```

Twenty tests, no game launch. It does not simulate RimWorld — it reads the
compiled game: the fields these defs write are checked against the methods that still read them,
and the two changes this port made are checked against the code that made them necessary. Sixteen of the original seventeen have been watched failing against a deliberately broken copy of the mod; the
seventeenth can only go red if RimWorld itself changes, and the file says so.

`TESTS.md` is the layer no reflection reaches: seven scenarios to play, for everything that has to
be *seen* — the animal drawn from four sides, an egg hatching, a corpse drying out.

## Terms

The continuation this port is built from is **MIT** (`LICENSE`, copyright Mlie, 2020), and that
notice ships with the mod, which is the condition MIT places on redistribution. Credit for the
animal itself belongs to Shooki.

If Shooki or Mlie comes back to it, or asks for this to be taken down, it comes down.

If I do not answer within a reasonable time after being contacted, anyone may freely update this or
any other of my mods, including publishing a continuation of it. All credit must be preserved.
