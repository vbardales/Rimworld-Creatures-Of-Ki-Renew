# Changelog

Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This file serves the repository and the writing of Steam patch notes; RimWorld does not display it
in game.

## [1.0.0] — unreleased

On release: create the `v1.0.0` tag and the matching GitHub release.

First release of the 1.6 update of the teshi from **Creatures of Ki**, by Shooki, continued by Mlie
through 1.4.

### Added

- Support for RimWorld 1.6.
- Complete French DefInjected coverage for the teshi, eggs, young animal, attacks and custom body-part labels.
- `EggTeshiUnfertilized`. The mod declared only its fertilized egg. Every egg-layer in Core
  declares both, without exception — chicken, duck, goose, turkey, ostrich, emu, cassowary, cobra,
  tortoise and iguana — and the teshi lays two eggs at a time with only one fertilization available
  (`eggCountRange` 2, `eggFertilizationCountMax` 1), so the second egg of a laying has nothing to
  be but unfertilized. The new def carries the fertilized egg's market value.

  An earlier wording of this entry said `CompEggLayer` throws whenever an animal lays without
  having been fertilized. That was stated too absolutely, and the point is now settled, read off
  the compiled game by `_tools/Run-Functional-Tests.ps1`: while an animal is unfertilized,
  `CompTick` writes `eggProgressUnfertilizedMax` straight into `eggProgress`, and `CanLayNow`
  requires a full 1. The teshi's setting is 0.9, inherited from upstream and not set here, so a
  lone female is pinned below the threshold and never lays at all. The crash described was
  therefore never possible for her. The def is needed all the same, for the mated case above.
- `LICENSE`, the upstream MIT notice, which is what MIT asks in exchange for redistribution.

### Changed

- Simplified the showcase icon to remove glow and orbital sparkles.
- Corrected the showcase anatomy description, verification documentation and final GitHub source link.

- **`wildness` moved to `<Wildness>` under `statBases`.** It stopped being a field of
  `RaceProperties` in 1.6 and became a StatDef. The old form is not an error, it is simply not
  read, and the stat's default is `-1` — outside the range the game uses, so the animal tames for
  almost nothing.

### Removed

- The Kija: the playable race, its two factions, its pawn kinds and its name makers, along with the
  Humanoid Alien Races dependency that came with them. This mod adds one animal and needs nothing.

### Notes

No balance value was changed. One defect inherited from the original is left in place on purpose
and documented in `ATTRIBUTION.md`: the dessicated teshi corpse uses the dromedary's texture.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-23

Creation of a publishIdFile. Prepublication: a first upload whose only purpose was to create the
Workshop item, private as Steam creates every new item, and to obtain `Mod/About/PublishedFileId.txt`,
which holds item `3806709627`. This entry does not say the mod is public or tested.

### Added

- `Mod/About/PublishedFileId.txt`, committed in `98a7c49`. Without it the next upload would create a
  second item instead of updating this one.

### Notes

- The upload contained `Mod/` as it stood at `3449ee5`. Nothing in `Mod/` has changed since, apart
  from that file.
- It was made from the working tree, which also held 9 `.dds` texture caches that the game had
  written beside the PNGs eighteen minutes earlier. They are not in git, so the private item probably
  carries them. This repository has no publish workflow yet: an upload from a git checkout drops
  them, one from the working tree sends them again.
- The features listed under 1.0.0 are still to come as a release. The `tested` and `prepublished`
  states have not been reached: see `STATUS.md`.
